## About

### The problem

When it comes to malaria elimination, policy-makers are faced with a difficult decision: should they divert resources from other important health areas (HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, etc.) to malaria elimination, since the "return on investment" would be so great in the long term, or should they spread resources around so as to minimalize morbidity and mortality in the short term?

### The solution

To answer this question, it is necessary to quantify the probability of and timeframe to achieving elimination, since the "expected value" of any investment requires some notion of likelihood and discount. for the purposes of quantifying likelihood of and time to country-specific malaria elimination, we propose a prediction market, a platform in which users "buy and sell ‘shares’ in a future event at a price that reflects their collective wisdom about the chance of the event happening" (Mann 2016). The concept has been applied to sports and politics, and have even started to make a foirée into science (Dreber et al. 2015, Almenberg, Kittlitz, and Pfeiffer (2009)).
